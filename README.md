#  AlamoPokemon

##### Date created: November 10, 2019

This toy App is meant to demonstrate the networking and boilerplate abstractions that are given in Alamofire, as well as provide a sample of using such high-level descriptions.


## Objectives:

1. To demonstrate an effective use of Alamofire.
2. To depthfully provide an adequate use-case for this framework beyond being "a wrapper around URLSession", which is the worst use of this framework.
3. To use Alamofire as a high-level description.
4. To leverage at least one advantageous benefit in Alamofire, of which the equivalent means to do so would consume a cumbersome amount of time to develop, test, and adequately scale for use.
